He\n        combined his nickname Woo (Which he obtained from his highschool\n        wrestling career), and the first four letters of his last name together.\n        He followed in his older brother Carlos footsteps when he was in the\n        process of naming his company, Carlos called his brand Los_Marc, and\n        Maserall approved of the name of his brother’s brand and decided to do\n        something similar. Additionally, family has the ability to allow someone\n        to unmask their true potential. Carlos, played a major role as a father\n        figure in Maserall’s life but another important individual who deserves\n        a great deal of credit in the formation of Woo.Marc is Maserall’s own\n        mother. Leaving Haiti to migrate to America to seek a better life for\n        herself and her children. Working constantly to support three children\n        and trying her hardest to conceal the true nature of her struggles in\n        front of her children. Maserall’s mother was dealing with a great amount\n        of pressure as a single parent. Maserall saw her as a pillar of strength\n        and admired her determination for her children. Witnessing the\n        hardworking nature his mother unveiled to him, Maserall dedicated\n        himself to improving the lives of those in his inner circle and the\n        people he meets through the standing of his organization.\n      </p>\n      {/* <figure> */}\n      <img\n        src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtxylaqlc/image/upload/v1604155237/A766997E-310F-4354-A203-C518EE52669B_n9jn2o.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Big Ass\"\n      />\n      <figcaption>Woo.Marc founder and CEO Maserall Marcelin</figcaption>\n      {/* </figure> */}\n      <p>\n        Inspiration can occur at any time. Prior to his company, Maserall was a\n        college graduate who obtained his degree in biomedical sciences in hopes\n        of starting a career as a pharmacist. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a\n        company called Big Vision located in Orlando, FL. Big Vision is a\n        marketing company working with a variety of companies to build marketing\n        plans, designing websites, and building apps. As Maserall continued to\n        do research on Big Vision, he was learning more and more how the company\n        operated. Seeing the way they built their teams from software\n        development, photography, and videography in a professional manner\n        created a stroke of inspiration in Maserall. Immediately, discovering\n        the way Big Vision operated; Maserall wanted to present that same degree\n        of professionalism to Eazy, the CEO of FFTE and suggested changes to the\n        FFTE website.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtxylaqlc/image/upload/v1604155255/2D0E9C3E-0426-4176-A305-EF498BD473C2_rddugu.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Eazy\"\n      />\n      {/* <img\n        src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtxylaqlc/image/upload/v1604155255/2D0E9C3E-0426-4176-A305-EF498BD473C2_rddugu.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Eazy\"\n      /> */}\n      <figcaption>CEO of FFTE</figcaption>\n      <p>\n        At the time Maserall was Eazy’s right hand man and they’ve been working\n        together closely for years, until Maserall resigned from his position to\n        focus on the formation of Woo.Marc. Even though he may not officially be\n        a FFTE member on the books, Maserall still maintains a great\n        relationship with the group and to this day still consults with them on\n        important matters.\n      </p>\n      <figure>\n        <img\n          src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtxylaqlc/image/upload/v1604155239/D4E26CC1-F06E-4314-9EAD-64D0141C3513_xtqtmn.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Big Ass\"\n        />\n        <figcaption>\n          Two bosses sitting together after a long awaited meeting\n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <div className=\"tip tip-left\">\n        <p>\n          Watch{\" \"}\n          <em>\n            <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1ndOr9Um0fn4Dy6AlaumYr?si=wiW-kFr6Qd27lMSocG_t3Q\">\n              Throw Away\n            </a>\n          </em>{\" \"}\n          by <strong>Hard Nard</strong> featuring <strong>Eazy</strong> on\n          <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-1DqVEfJECk\">YouTube</a>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        In the past, Woo.Marc has faced its own set of challenges. One\n        difficulty the organization had to overcome was figuring out what\n        specific services they were going to provide their clients. After\n        leaving FFTE, Maserall had taken on several different projects ranging\n        from video editing and videography, to building websites. Discovering\n        the company's identity, and how to move it forward became his top\n        priority.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After some deep internal revision, going through all the projects that\n        he had taken on over the years, Maserall made the decision to provide\n        web development services to through Woo,Marc. This was the one area\n        where he felt he could tie in all of the things he loved to do. To\n        further invest in himself, he enrolled in a six month web development\n        bootcamp where he learned how to become master creative with mobile\n        phones and web browsers as his canvas.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtxylaqlc/image/upload/v1604155236/B3E09892-449A-46E4-BD00-BB5EE5E84723_chkfby.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Maserall taking a sip of Jack Daniels Tennesee Honey Whiskey\"\n      />\n      <figcaption>\n        Taking a sip of his favorite whiskey Jack Daniels Tennesee Honey\n      </figcaption>\n      <p>\n        During this foundational time, Maserall also realized that when he\n        looked at the things he loved doing (from videos, photography, etc),\n        he’d rather do it for himself than for others. This was solely due to\n        his creative vision for certain projects not correlating with the\n        visions of others he had worked with, sparking a conflict of interest.\n        But Maserall began to understand that no matter how many conflicts and\n        disagreements may occur, the client's vision for their project is what\n        matters the most. And even if the creative process takes a different\n        direction, Maserall would still be present to offer sound advice to his\n        clients to ensure the highest quality of service.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the end, Woo.Marc is a company that specializes in building websites,\n        mobile apps, and digital marketing.
