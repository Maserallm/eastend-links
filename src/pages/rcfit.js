        Firstly, let's begin by agreeing that anyone who takes the initiative to
        improve their health by starting their fitness journey is truly
        admirable. Whether you get active at the gym, ring, or even the great
        outdoors, taking that leap to achieve your fitness goals is something
        everyone should strive to do. We here at Eastend Links came upon Ryan
        Clarke, a personal trainer who originally hailed from Jamaica, who runs
        his own company called RC FIT 7. The story of Ryan Clarke is a humbling,
        yet inspiring story brimmed with faith, community, and the love of
        fitness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ryan’s journey in the fitness industry began when he was working at one
        of Publix’s warehouses as a selector. Life for him felt repetitive as he
        grew tired of falling into the same daily routine with his job and
        wanted to control more aspects of his life. As he continued to work for
        the Publix, Ryan was charged with training the associates at his
        location and his co-workers always encouraged him to pursue a career in
        personal training. In time, he made the decision to get certified
        through NASM as a personal trainer and started training part time while
        still working at Publix.
      </p>

      <p>
        The beginning of RC FIT 7 started with Ryan working out with a group of
        friends in different parks across Central Florida to help RC FIT 7 gain
        exposure. Eventually, Ryan came across Celebration, Florida, which is
        now where RC FIT 7 mainly operates from. Additionally, Ryans wife,
        Dominique, played a monumental role in the formation of RC FIT 7. She
        helped Ryan expand the foundational ground-work of the company by doing
        the majority of the background work, such as setting up their business,
        marketing, and book-keeping. Realizing that working full-time at Publix
        was taking so much of his energy away from RC FIT 7, Ryan had to make a
        life changing decision. After calculating his finances, managing the
        risk associated with leaving Publix, and receiving some wise counsel,
        Ryan took a leap of faith and decided to leave Publix to run RC FIT 7
        full-time.

      <p>
        Additionally, faith plays a major role in Ryan’s personal life and
        business. As a follower of Christ, loving other people and loving God is
        a top priority in his life. As we dive deeper into RC FIT 7 you may
        notice that their logo is two barbells resembling a cross with a purple
        sashe, signifying the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus has made for
        humanity and the sashe highlighting his royal status. Also, the number
        seven in the company’s name bears significance as well. In scriptures
        seven is described as the perfect number. Ryan’s goal with this logo and
        the number seven in his company's name was to highlight his faith and
        combine that with fitness, to build a community that welcomes all to
        come as you are. The RC FIT 7 community revolves around the love of
        fitness, respect for one another, and personal growth. A community truly
        seeking to build each other up.

        The global pandemic has shifted the dynamics on how we all have to live
        our daily lives. As the pandemic grew more severe and having a new-born
        child during these times, Ryan had to shift the way he managed his
        business, while being safe. Online coaching was Ryan's solution to train
        his clients during the pandemic, which also allowed him to train people
        all over the world. Even as things were opening up in Florida, Ryan’s
        clients were still hesitant on doing face to face training and so was
        he, due to the fact he was concerned for his clients and his own
        family’s health. Pre-COVID during group classes, everyone would be
        high-fiving and hugging each other to motivate the group. Now, nearly a
        year after the start of the pandemic, most of the RC FIT 7 community
        follows the CDC’s guidelines to maintain six-feet from each other to
        reduce the spread of the virus. Furthermore, having a child during the
        pandemic has forced Ryan to be more structured with his schedule.
        Before, he was free to work with a client practically anytime, but now
        his child is his top priority. Although taking care of an infant may be
        tiring at times, it doesn't stop Ryan from achieving great things with
        RC FIT 7.

        Many gyms were closed temporarily due to COVID-19. As most gyms plan on
        reopening, a lot of concerns began to pile up on our minds. Do they have
        sanitizer wipes or bottles to clean equipment? How many people are
        there? Will there be social distancing? Ryan himself thought of these
        concerns as he is an avid gym rat himself. The majority of RC FIT 7’s
        training takes place outdoors and Ryan has come up with a creative
        solution to tackle most of these problems. Ryan’s goal is to create a
        mobile gym, with the intention of having gym equipment accessible
        outside for his clients, while continuing outdoor training.

        In the end, Ryan Clarke is a personal trainer who operates RC FIT 7.
        This story is truly inspirational as it highlights faith, community, and
        the love of fitness. Those who seek to train at RC FIT 7 can find Ryan
