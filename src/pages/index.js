        The moniker Woo.Marc is closely related to Maserall’s personal life. He
        combined his nickname Woo (Which he obtained from his highschool
        wrestling career), and the first four letters of his last name together.
        He followed in his older brother Carlos footsteps when he was in the
        process of naming his company, Carlos called his brand Los_Marc, and
        Maserall approved of the name of his brother’s brand and decided to do
        something similar. Additionally, family has the ability to allow someone
        to unmask their true potential. Carlos, played a major role as a father
        figure in Maserall’s life but another important individual who deserves
        a great deal of credit in the formation of Woo.Marc is Maserall’s own
        mother. Leaving Haiti to migrate to America to seek a better life for
        herself and her children. Working constantly to support three children
        and trying her hardest to conceal the true nature of her struggles in
        front of her children. Maserall’s mother was dealing with a great amount
        of pressure as a single parent. Maserall saw her as a pillar of strength
        and admired her determination for her children. Witnessing the
        hardworking nature his mother unveiled to him, Maserall dedicated
        himself to improving the lives of those in his inner circle and the
        people he meets through the standing of his organization.

        Inspiration can occur at any time. Prior to his company, Maserall was a
        college graduate who obtained his degree in biomedical sciences in hopes
        of starting a career as a pharmacist. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a
        company called Big Vision located in Orlando, FL. Big Vision is a
        marketing company working with a variety of companies to build marketing
        plans, designing websites, and building apps. As Maserall continued to
        do research on Big Vision, he was learning more and more how the company
        operated. Seeing the way they built their teams from software
        development, photography, and videography in a professional manner
        created a stroke of inspiration in Maserall. Immediately, discovering
        the way Big Vision operated; Maserall wanted to present that same degree
        of professionalism to Eazy, the CEO of FFTE and suggested changes to the
        FFTE website.

        At the time Maserall was Eazy’s right hand man and they’ve been working
        together closely for years, until Maserall resigned from his position to
        focus on the formation of Woo.Marc. Even though he may not officially be
        a FFTE member on the books, Maserall still maintains a great
        relationship with the group and to this day still consults with them on
        important matters.

        In the past, Woo.Marc has faced its own set of challenges. One
        difficulty the organization had to overcome was figuring out what
        specific services they were going to provide their clients. After
        leaving FFTE, Maserall had taken on several different projects ranging
        from video editing and videography, to building websites. Discovering
        the company's identity, and how to move it forward became his top
        priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some deep internal revision, going through all the projects that
        he had taken on over the years, Maserall made the decision to provide
        web development services to through Woo,Marc. This was the one area
        where he felt he could tie in all of the things he loved to do. To
        further invest in himself, he enrolled in a six month web development
        bootcamp where he learned how to become master creative with mobile
        phones and web browsers as his canvas.
      </p>

        During this foundational time, Maserall also realized that when he
        looked at the things he loved doing (from videos, photography, etc),
        he’d rather do it for himself than for others. This was solely due to
        his creative vision for certain projects not correlating with the
        visions of others he had worked with, sparking a conflict of interest.
        But Maserall began to understand that no matter how many conflicts and
        disagreements may occur, the client's vision for their project is what
        matters the most. And even if the creative process takes a different
        direction, Maserall would still be present to offer sound advice to his
        clients to ensure the highest quality of service.

        In the end, Woo.Marc is a company that specializes in building websites,
        mobile apps, and digital marketing. The company’s formation came from
        humble beginnings, stemming from an idea now turned into reality.
